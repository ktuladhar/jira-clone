## About

This is a fork of [oldboyxx/jira_clone](https://github.com/oldboyxx/jira_clone) — a full-featured Jira-style project management app built as a showcase of modern React and Node.js patterns.

Unlike many tutorial projects, this codebase has real-world complexity: drag-and-drop kanban boards, rich issue modals, custom UI components, and a typed REST API — while remaining readable enough to learn from.

**Repository:** [github.com/ktuladhar/jira-clone](https://github.com/ktuladhar/jira-clone)

## App features

### Kanban board
- Four-column board: **Backlog**, **Selected for development**, **In progress**, and **Done**
- Drag-and-drop issues between columns and within a column ([react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd))
- Filter issues by assignee, type, and search text

### Issue management
- Create, view, edit, and delete issues
- Issue types: **Task**, **Bug**, **Story**
- Priority levels from Lowest to Highest
- Rich-text description editor ([Quill](https://quilljs.com/))
- Assignees and reporter
- Due dates with a custom date/time picker
- Time tracking (original estimate, time spent, remaining)

### Comments
- Add, edit, and delete comments on issues
- Rich-text comment editor

### Project tools
- Issue search modal
- Project settings (name, URL, description, category, avatar)
- Guest authentication — visiting the app auto-creates a session with seeded sample data

### Demo data
- Seeded project: **Singularity v1.0**
- Six chess-themed team members: **Queen**, **Rook**, **King**, **Bishop**, **Horse**, and **Pawn** (with matching piece avatars)
- Logged-in guest user: **King**

```

## Architecture

### Client
- **No Redux/MobX** — state is managed locally with React hooks and a custom `useApi` hook for data fetching
- **Custom Webpack setup** — no Create React App; full control over the build pipeline
- **Shared component library** — Modal, Select, DatePicker, TextEditor, Form, Button, Tooltip, and more built in-house
- **Query-param modals** — issue search and create modals are driven by URL query parameters

### API
- **Express REST API** with JWT bearer-token authentication
- **TypeORM 0.3** with PostgreSQL 18; schema is auto-synchronized on startup (no migrations yet)
- **Guest accounts** — `POST /authentication/guest` creates a user, project, sample issues, and six chess-themed team members (see [Demo data](#demo-data))
- **Entity relationships** — Projects have many Issues; Issues have many Comments and many-to-many Users (assignees)

### Client auth
- Unauthenticated visits redirect to `/authenticate` before loading the board
- JWT is stored in `localStorage` as `authToken`
- Clear the token to start a fresh guest session with new seed data

### API endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/authentication/guest` | Create guest session and receive JWT |
| `GET` | `/currentUser` | Get authenticated user |
| `GET` | `/project` | Get project with users and issues |
| `PUT` | `/project` | Update project settings |
| `GET` | `/issues` | List all project issues |
| `GET` | `/issues/:issueId` | Get issue with users and comments |
| `POST` | `/issues` | Create issue |
| `PUT` | `/issues/:issueId` | Update issue |
| `DELETE` | `/issues/:issueId` | Delete issue |
| `POST` | `/comments` | Create comment |
| `PUT` | `/comments/:commentId` | Update comment |
| `DELETE` | `/comments/:commentId` | Delete comment |

## Fork changes

This fork includes compatibility updates for modern development environments:

- **TypeORM upgraded to 0.3** with **PostgreSQL 18** support (previously required PostgreSQL 11)
- **`pg` upgraded to v8** — fixes silent connection failures on Node.js 18+
- **Chess-themed guest seed data** — six demo users with piece avatars and **Singularity v1.0** project
- **Client auth routing** — authenticate before hitting protected API routes
- **Node.js 18+ client startup** — OpenSSL legacy provider set via `cross-env` in npm scripts
- **API startup messages** — clearer errors for port conflicts and database connection failures
- **Auto port cleanup** — `npm start` in `/api` and `/client` frees ports **3000** and **8080** before launching
- **Client dev server** — binds to all interfaces so both `localhost:8080` and `127.0.0.1:8080` work
- **README and repo links** updated to point to [ktuladhar/jira-clone](https://github.com/ktuladhar/jira-clone)

## Setting up development environment 🛠

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 16–20** recommended (see [Node.js notes](#nodejs-notes) for Node 18+)
- **PostgreSQL 14+** — tested with **PostgreSQL 18**

### Database

Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and create a database named `jira_development`, or run Postgres 18 with Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name jira-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=jira_development \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:18
```

If you use a non-default port, set `DB_PORT` in your `/api/.env` file accordingly.

### First-time setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ktuladhar/jira-clone.git
cd jira-clone
```

1. Create an empty `.env` file in `/api`, copy `/api/.env.example` contents into it, and fill in your database credentials.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm run install-dependencies
```

See also: [api/README.md](api/README.md) and [client/README.md](client/README.md).

### Running the app (every time)

You need **two terminals** — one for the API and one for the client. PostgreSQL must be running before you start the API.

**Terminal 1 — API** (port **3000**):

```bash
cd api
npm start
```

Wait until you see:

```text
API listening on http://localhost:3000
```

**Terminal 2 — Client** (port **8080**):

```bash
cd client
npm start
```

Wait until you see:

```text
Project is running at http://localhost:8080/
```

**Open the app:** [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

The app signs you in as a guest and loads the **Singularity v1.0** demo board.

> **Important:** Open the **client** at port **8080**, not the API at port **3000**. Port 3000 is the REST API only — it is not the website.

**Stopping:** Press **Ctrl+C** in each terminal when you are done. If you close a terminal without stopping the server, the process may keep running and block the port next time.

**Port already in use?** Each `npm start` automatically frees its port before launching (`3000` for the API, `8080` for the client). You can also run manually:

```bash
cd api && npm run stop      # free port 3000
cd client && npm run stop   # free port 8080
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DB_HOST` | PostgreSQL host | `localhost` |
| `DB_PORT` | PostgreSQL port | `5432` |
| `DB_USERNAME` | Database user | — |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | Database password | — |
| `DB_DATABASE` | Database name | `jira_development` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret for signing auth tokens | — |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment (`development`, `test`, `production`) | `development` |

### Node.js notes

**Client (Node 18+):** Webpack 4 requires the OpenSSL legacy provider. The `npm start` and `npm run build` scripts set this automatically via `cross-env`. If you still see `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED`, run `npm install` in `/client` first.

**API (Windows):** The start script uses `npx ts-node` so no manual PATH setup is required.

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `Port 3000 is already in use` | Run `cd api && npm run stop`, then `npm start` again |
| `Port 8080 is already in use` | Run `cd client && npm run stop`, then `npm start` again |
| Website shows a spinner forever | Start the API first — the client needs it on port **3000**. Check Terminal 1 for `API listening on http://localhost:3000` |
| Opened `localhost:3000` in the browser | That is the API, not the app. Use [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) |
| `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED` (client) | Run `npm install` in `/client` — do not run `npm audit fix --force` |
| `npm install` fails in `/client` | Use the pinned versions in `package-lock.json`; avoid `npm update` |
| Stale demo users or project name | DevTools → Console: `localStorage.removeItem('authToken'); location.reload()` |
| Board loads but no data | Ensure the API is running on port **3000** |

### Production build

```bash
npm run build          # Compile API (TypeScript) and client (Webpack)
npm run start:production
```

## Running Cypress end-to-end tests 🚥

1. Set up the development environment
2. Create a database named `jira_test`
3. Start the API in test mode: `cd api && npm run start:test`
4. Open Cypress: `cd client && npm run test:cypress`

Test suites cover authentication, issue create/details, drag-and-drop, filters, search, and project settings.

## What's missing?

Features that would exist in a production app but are intentionally out of scope for this showcase:

### Migrations 🗄

TypeORM's `synchronize` auto-creates the database schema on every launch. Before going live, [introduce migrations](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/docs/migrations.md).

### Proper authentication 🔐

The app uses guest tokens with seeded data. A real product would need email/password auth, registration, and password reset.

### Accessibility ♿

Not all components have full [ARIA attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) or visible focus indicators.

### Unit/integration tests 🧪

Coverage is primarily through [Cypress E2E tests](https://github.com/ktuladhar/jira-clone/tree/master/client/cypress/integration). Unit and integration tests would be valuable as the app grows.
